# Udacity-Project-Plagiarism-Detection
A plagiarism detector was built, trained, and deployed with AWS SageMaker for examining a text file and performing binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. Containment and longest common subsequence were the features extracted from the text files for building the binary classification model.
